    Create a list, , of empty sequences, where each sequence is indexed from to . The elements within each of the sequences also use -indexing.
    Create an integer, , and initialize it to .
    The types of queries that can be performed on your list of sequences () are described below:
        Query: 1 x y
            Find the sequence, , at index in .
            Append integer to sequence .
        Query: 2 x y
            Find the sequence, , at index in .
            Find the value of element in (where is the size of ) and assign it to .
            Print the new value of on a new line
